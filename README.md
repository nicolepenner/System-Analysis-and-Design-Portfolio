# System-Analysis-and-Design-Portfolio


# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The client for this project was Liam who is the owner of DriverPass. DriverPass aims to provide better driver's training education. The owner, Liam, felt that current options were subpar and too many students were failing their driving tests. DriverPass wanted a system that allowed for students to review lessons and take tests online. They also wanted students to be able to schedule driving appointments online, view notes from instructors, view their progress, and be able to browse and purchase driving packages online. Overall DriverPass wanted to create a better driver's training course, that is flexible and helps students to pass their driver's test. The model combines in person instruction and online lessons, tests, and resources. 


# What did you do particularly well?

  I was able to break down and meet all their requirements for the DriverPass system. I used the requirements that we talked about in the interview with DriverPass, I took detailed notes, and case able to put these required functionalities into use cases. I think my use case diagram was created particularly well, and I was able to capture all the wants of DriverPass effectively. I also think I was able to address security concerns for DriverPass particularly well, and have methods in place to ensure user's information stays secure. 


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I think if I could revise anything I may go back and look at my class diagram and activity diagrams. I created them to the best of my abilities, but I think there could be more concepts and functionalities that could be added. I know class diagrams can potentiallu get too complex, and I was concerned about that. Ideally I would probably add more details and actually write out the methods even if it wasn't required. I had never created an activity diagram before, I was concerned with them becoming too complex. I think I would go back and add a little more representation of different functionalities. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  To ensure I met all of the needs of the user, I considered many factors. First I looked at what the client wanted us to include, and the functionality they wanted customers to have with their account. The user's needs are important to consider because withot user's a system cannot be successful. You want user's to be able to depend on being able to use the system when they need to, keep their information and personal data safe, and for the website to have all the functionalities they may need.I thought about the user when I added two-step verification to login to their account. This is a method of keeping their information safe, and they can choose to opt in or not. This also takes into consideration making the user interface user friendly. This is so customers can find what they need and not have to search too hard to find different functionalities of the site. I interpreted the user to want to keep their information safe, have the website be reliable and dependable, user friendly, and have all the functionalities they will need to succeed when they take their driving test. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I think adopting an iterative and incremental software development approach sets a developer up for success. I started by looking over the interview and taking detailed notes as to not miss any important features and functionalities the client wanted to include. I would then create a timeline based on this interview and decide on different deliverables and when they shoould be completed to keep on track. I then would create a use case diagram, activity, sequence, and a class diagram to aid me in programming the system. I know I don't need everything in the diagrams, but they help me to have an idea of what I need to include and will help to process to wirte the code for the system. I think the diagrams are a key tool to help jumpstart the coding process, and I will make use of them in the future. Overall I think my method is relatively strong and a good way to analyze and make sure the system has all the needed functionalities for client and user.
